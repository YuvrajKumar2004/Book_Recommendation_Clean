# **Data Visualization Project**

## **Book Recommendation**
This project analyzes a book dataset using Python libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. It includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and clustering** to uncover trends in book ratings, authors, and languages. Insights can inform recommendation systems or predictive models.

## **Dataset Used**
- [**BOOK DATA SET**](https://github.com/Rathore13055/Book_Recommendation/blob/main/file_updated2.csv)

## **Key Questions**
- What are the most popular books based on ratings?
- How does the distribution of book ratings vary?
- Which authors have the highest-rated books?
- How do different languages influence book ratings?
- Can clustering techniques help in categorizing books?

## **Process**
✔ **Verify** data for missing values and inconsistencies, and clean the data accordingly.
✔ **Ensure** data consistency in terms of format, types, and values.
✔ **Utilize** visualization libraries like **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly** to represent the data effectively.
✔ **Create** various types of plots and charts to answer key analytical questions.
✔ **Combine** visual elements into a coherent **dashboard** for better interactivity and dynamic insights.
